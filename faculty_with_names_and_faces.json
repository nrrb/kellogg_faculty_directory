Narrow Networks On The Health Insurance Marketplaces: Prevalence, Pricing, And The Cost Of Network Breadth. Health Affairs. 36(9): 1606-1614.Anecdotal reports and systematic research highlight the prevalence of narrow-network plans on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance Marketplaces. At the same time, Marketplace premiums in the period 2014\u201316 were much lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office in 2009. Using detailed data on the breadth of both hospital and physician networks, we studied the prevalence of narrow networks and quantified the association between network breadth and premiums. Controlling for many potentially confounding factors, we found that a plan with narrow physician and hospital networks was 16 percent cheaper than a plan with broad networks for both, and that narrowing the breadth of just one type of network was associated with a 6\u20139 percent decrease in premiums. Narrow-network plans also have a sizable impact on federal outlays, as they depress the premium of the second-lowest-price silver plan, to which subsidy amounts are linked. Holding all else constant, we estimate that federal subsidies would have been 10.8 percent higher in 2014 had Marketplaces required all plans to offer broad provider networks. Narrow networks are a promising source of potential savings for other segments of the commercial insurance market.", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Constantinos Skiadas", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/skiadas_constantinos.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/skiadas_c.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": "Asset pricing theory, choice under uncertainty, mathematical economics", "personal_site": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/skiadas/home.htm"}, {"name": "Craig Furfine", "title": "Clinical Professor of Finance", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/furfine_craig.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/furfine_c.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": "Commercial real estate finance; securitization; commercial and residential mortgages; bank capital requirements; interbank markets", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Craig Garthwaite", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/garthwaite_craig.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Garthwaite_Craig_111416.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "STRATEGY", "research_interests": "Health Economics; Pharmaceutical Industry; Public Finance; Political Economy", "personal_site": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/garthwaite/htm/index.htm"}, {"name": "Craig Wortmann", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/wortmann_craig.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Wortmann_Craig_011017.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "INNOVATION & ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "research_interests": "Wortmann, Craig. \"What's your Story?\" : using stories to ignite performance and be more successful.

Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity. London: Elsevier, Academic Press, 3rd ed.The world of finance dramatically changed following the global financial meltdown of 2007-09, and this change has continued following Brexit in 2016 and the new administration that took over in the United States during 2017. These significant events have caused governments and financial industry to look again at investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity through a new lens. Market participants have been significantly impacted, and attitudes toward risk, transparency, regulation, and compensation have changed. Investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms are at the epicenter of a transformed financial landscape, forging new roles and seeking new ways to create value within a paradigm of lower risk and greater regulation. This book provides an overview of investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms and describes the relationships between these organizations: how they both compete with and provide important services to each other, and the significant impact they have on corporations, governments, institutional investors, and individuals. Together, they have reshaped global financing and investing patterns, attracting envy and awe, but also criticism and concern. They dominate the headlines of the financial press and create wealth for many of their managers and investing clients. This book enables readers to better understand these heavily interconnected organizations, their impact on the global financial market, historical development, principal activities, regulatory environment, and risks and opportunities. Ultimately, the objective of this book is to demystify investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms, revealing their key functions, compensation systems, unique role in wealth creation and risk management and their epic battle for investor funds, and corporate influence. After reading this book, the reader should better understand financial press headlines that herald massive corporate takeovers, corporate shareholder activism, large capital market financings and the myriad strategies, risks, and conflicts in the financial market landscape. The inclusion of case studies and spreadsheet models provides an analytical framework that allows the reader to apply the book's lessons to real-world financing, investing, and advisory activities.", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Dean DeBiase", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer of Innovation & Entrepreneurship", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/debiase_dean.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/DeBiase_Dean_012814.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "INNOVATION & ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "research_interests": "DeBiase, Dean. 2014. \"Essays: Leadership Entrepreneurial Innovation.\" In Innovation Alchemists.", "personal_site": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/deandebiase/"}, {"name": "Dean Karlan", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/karlan_dean.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Karlan_ Dean 05162017_cropped.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": "https://karlan.yale.edu"}, {"name": "Deepak Chopra", "title": "Adjunct Professor of Executive Education", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/chopra_deepak.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Chopra_Deepak_090415.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": "http://www.choprafoundation.org"}, {"name": "Derek D.

Individual Discount Rates and Climate Change: Is Discount Rate Associated With Support for a Carbon Tax?. Climate Change EConomics. 6(4)The issue of climate change is often framed as one in which contemporary actions, often with affixed costs, are necessary in order to prevent even greater costs being paid during a period in the future. Under such a framework it is thus necessary to calculate the rate in which future benefits are discounted to reflect current values. In this paper we examine how individual level discount rates affect their support for a policy tool that incurs contemporary costs in an effort to prevent future environmental damages. We find that individuals with higher discount rates are significantly less likely to support the imposition of a carbon tax in comparison with individuals that have lower discount rates. Even when controlling for other individual level attributes such as party affiliation a person\u2019s rate for discounting the future is shown to be a strong predictor of their support for a carbon tax.", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Donald Haider", "title": "Professor Emeritus of Strategy", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/haider_donald.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Haider_Donald_RGB14.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "STRATEGY", "research_interests": "Nonprofit mergers and alliances, public finance and management, economic development", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Donald Jacobs", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/jacobs_donald.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/jacobs_d.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": "Banking, capital markets, monetary policy, corporate finance, international finance", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Douglas Conant", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/conant_douglas.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Conant_Douglas_010314.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Dylan Minor", "title": "Assistant Professor of Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/minor_dylan.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/minor_d.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS & DECISION SCIENCES", "research_interests": "Applications: Business and Society, Incentives in Organizations, Corporate Governance and Corruption  Methods: Game Theory, Auctions, Experimental Economics and Applied Econometrics", "personal_site": "http://www.dylanminor.com"}, {"name": "Edward (Ned) Smith", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/smith_edward.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Smith_Ned_0913.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATIONS", "research_interests": "Decision Making, Social Networks, Organizational and Group Structure and Relationships, Market Emergence, Creativity and Innovation, Social Structure of Organizations and Markets", "personal_site": "http://www.ned-smith.com"}, {"name": "Edward F.X.

I show that consumers price-shop in the highly simplified price information environment of health insurance plans with tiered hospital networks.

We find that independent directors earn positive and substantial abnormal returns when they purchase their company stock, and that the difference with the same firm s officers is relatively small at most horizons. The results are robust to controlling for firm fixed effects and to using a variety of alternative specifications. Executive officers and independent directors make higher returns in firms with weaker governance and the gap between these two groups widens in such firms. Independent directors who sit in audit committees earn higher return than other independent directors at the same firm.

This ruling was intended to curb abusive patent lawsuits by providing more flexibility in the way courts remedy patent violations. I estimate the causal impact of the decision by comparing firms that were differentially affected by the shock, measured by exogenous firm-level exposure to patent litigation before 2006. Across a large sample of innovative firms, the decision led to an increase in the quality and quantity of patenting and, for public firms, in R&D investment. Then, I show that patent litigation reduces investment in innovation by lowering the returns from R&D and by exacerbating financing constraints. This evidence confirms that patent litigation plays an important role in hindering innovation, and therefore that adjustments in the enforcement of patent law can have sizable effects on R&D.", "personal_site": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/mezzanotti/index.html"}, {"name": "Florian Zettelmeyer", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/zettelmeyer_florian.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/zettlemeyer_f.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MARKETING", "research_interests": "Marketing Analytics, Big Data, marketing implications of consumer search and uncertainty, industrial organization, pricing, Internet, environmental economics", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Frank Limbrock", "title": "Research Assistant Professor of Strategy", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/limbrock_frank.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Limbrock_Frank_13_RGB.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "STRATEGY", "research_interests": "Health Economics; Industrial Organization; Applied Econometrics", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Fred Harburg", "title": "Clinical Professor of Executive Education", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/harburg_fred.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Harburg_Fred 03022018 cropped.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Gabriel Vehovsky", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer of Innovation & Entrepreneurship", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/vehovsky_gabriel.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Vehovsky_Gabriel_092314.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "INNOVATION & ENTREPRENEURSHIP", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Gail Berger", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/berger_gail.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Berger_Gail 03132018.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": "Harrington, Brynn,\u00a0Gail Berger Darlow and\u00a0Mindy Douthit. 2010.

Global Aircraft Manufacturing, 2002\u20132011. Case 5-312-505 (KEL938).At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Boeing and Airbus, the leading manufacturers of large aircraft, were locked in a battle for market share that drove down prices for their new planes. At about the same time, the two industry heavyweights began developing new aircraft families to address the future market needs they each projected.\nAircraft take many years to develop, so by the time the new planes made their inaugural flights, significant changes had occurred in the global environment. First, emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere were growing rapidly, spawning immediate and long-term demand for more aircraft. At the same time, changes to the market for air travel had created opportunities for new products. These opportunities had not gone unnoticed by potential new entrants, which were positioning themselves to compete against the market leaders.\nIn October 2007, the Airbus superjumbo A380 made its first flight.

Regulating Household Leverage.This paper studies how credit markets respond to policy constraints on household leverage. Exploiting a sharp policy-induced discontinuity in the cost of originating certain high-leverage mortgages, we study how the Dodd-Frank \u201cAbility-to-Repay\u201d rule affected the price and availability of credit in the U.S. mortgage market. Our estimates show that the policy had only moderate effects on prices, increasing interest rates on affected loans by 10-15 basis points. The effect on quantities, however, was signi\ufb01cantly larger; we estimate that the policy eliminated 15 percent of the affected market completely and reduced leverage for another 20 percent of remaining borrowers. This reduction in quantities is much greater than would be implied by plausible demand elasticities and suggests that lenders responded to the policy primarily by rationing credit. Finally, while the policy succeeded in reducing leverage, our estimates suggest this effect would have only slightly reduced aggregate default rates during the housing crisis.", "personal_site": "https://sites.google.com/site/johnnelsonmondragon/"}, {"name": "Jonathan Copulsky", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer of Marketing", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/copulsky_jonathan.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Copulsky_Jonathan_110216.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MARKETING", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Jorg Spenkuch", "title": "Associate Professor of Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/spenkuch_jorg.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Spenkuch_Jorg.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS & DECISION SCIENCES", "research_interests": "Political Economy and Applied Microeconomics", "personal_site": "http://kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/spenkuch/index.html"}, {"name": "Jose Maria Liberti", "title": "Visiting Professor of Finance", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/liberti_jose.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Liberti_Jose_0008_10RGB.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": "Empirical Corporate Finance, Financial Intermediation, Organizational Economics, Theory of the Firm", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Joseph Hannigan", "title": "Adjunct Professor of Executive Education", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/hannigan_joseph.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/hannigan_joe.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Joshua Daitch", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer of Real Estate", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/daitch_joshua.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/2016-2017- tenure-line/Daitch_Joshua 04192017.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Joshua Mollner", "title": "Assistant Professor of Managerial Economics & Decision Sciences", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/mollner_joshua.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Mollner_Joshua_090816.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS & DECISION SCIENCES", "research_interests": "Milgrom, Paul and\u00a0Joshua Mollner. 2018.

Exploring the Case for a Global Alliance for Medical Diagnostics Initiative. Diagnostics. 7(1): 8.In recent years, the private and public sectors have increased investments in medical diagnostics for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite these investments, numerous barriers prevent the adoption of existing diagnostics and discourage the development and introduction of new diagnostics in LMICs. In the late 1990s, the global vaccine community had similar challenges, as vaccine coverage rates stagnated and the introduction of new vaccines was viewed as a distraction to delivering existing vaccines. To address these challenges, the international community came together and formed the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative (GAVI). Sixteen years after the formation of GAVI, we see evidence of a healthier global vaccine landscape. We discuss how GAVI\u2019s four guiding principles (product, health systems strengthening, financing and market shaping) might apply to the advancement of medical diagnostics in LMICs. We present arguments for the international community and existing organizations to establish a Global Alliance for Medical Diagnostics Initiative (GAMDI).", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Karen

Managing Careers in Organizations. Journal of Labor Economics.A firm's organizational structure imposes constraints on its ability to use promotion-based incentive systems. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a framework for identifying these constraints and exploring their consequences. We show that firms manage workers' careers by putting in place personnel policies that optimally resemble an internal labor market. Firms may adopt forced-turnover policies in order to keep lines of advancement open. In addition, they may alter their organizational structures to relax these constraints. This gives rise to a trade-off between incentive provision at the worker level and productive efficiency at the firm level. Our framework generates novel testable implications that connect firm-level characteristics with workers' careers in ways that are consistent with a rich set of empirical findings.", "personal_site": "http://www.pareto-optimal.com"}, {"name": "Michael Xenakis", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer of Finance", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/xenakis_michael.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Xenakis_Michael_012917.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Michal Maimaran", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/maimaran_michal.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Maimaran_Michal_2012.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "MARKETING", "research_interests": "Children Decision Making, Consumer Judgment and Decision Making", "personal_site": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/maimaran/personal/index.html"}, {"name": "Michele Rogers", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rogers_michele.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Rogers_Michelle_111416.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": "na", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "Michelle L.

Forthcoming. Aint it Suite? Bundling in the PC Office Software Market. Strategic Management Journal.We examine the importance of office suites for the evolution of the PC office software market in the 1990s. An estimated discrete demand choice model reveals a positive correlation of consumer values for spreadsheets and word processors, a bonus value for suites, and advantages for Microsoft products. We employ the estimates to simulate various hypothetical market structures to evaluate the profitability, welfare, and competitive effects of suites under alternative correlation assumptions. We find that greater correlation enhances the profitability of bundling due to the interaction of a market expansion effect and a suite bonus effect. In a partial competition setting in which Lotus sells only a spreadsheet and WordPerfect sells only a word processor, we find that Microsoft\u2019s introduction of the suite increases consumer welfare. Furthermore, while the Lotus and WordPerfect suites gained little market acceptance, a merger that creates a new suite combining the best products of both enhances competition only if the new suite overcomes Microsoft\u2019s unobserved quality advantage.", "personal_site": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/markovich/index.html"}, {"name": "Scott Baker", "title": "Assistant Professor of Finance", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/baker_scott_r.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Baker_Scott_081114.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": "Empirical Macroeconomics, Household Finance , Economics of Uncertainty, Labor", "personal_site": "https://sites.google.com/site/srbaker/"}, {"name": "Scott Schaefer", "title": "Visiting Professor of Strategy", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/schaefer_scott.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Schaeffer_Scott.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "STRATEGY", "research_interests": "Haynes, Rachel M. and\u00a0Scott Schaefer. 2009.

Predicting Equity Liquidity. Management Science. 48(4): 470-483.In this paper we quantify equity liquidity using a measure of price impact, the change in a firm's stock price associated with its observed net trading volume and relate the measured price impact to a set of predetermined firm characteristics that serve as proxies for the severity of adverse selection in the equity market, the non-information based costs of making a market in the stock, and the extent of shareholder heterogeneity; and compare, out-of-sample, our characteristic-based estimates of price impact to actual price impacts. Increasing the magnitude of net turnover during a 5-minute interval by 0.1% of the shares outstanding produces an average incremental price effect of 2.65% for NYSE and AMEX listed firms and 1.85% for NASDAQ firms. These averages, however, mask considerable cross-sectional variation. We present evidence that liquidity varies cross-sectionally as a function of predetermined firm characteristics as predicted by theories based on adverse selection, market making costs, and shareholder heterogeneity. We also find intra-day patterns, with the price impact being higher at the beginning and end of the trading day relative to the middle of the day. For a large set of institutional trades we examine the relation between actual price impact and that predicted out-of-sample using the cross sectional relation between firm characteristics and price impact. We find numerous aspects of trade execution which are significantly related to the price impact forecast error in intuitive ways: for example, the predicted price impact overestimates the actual price impact for very large trades, for trades executed in a more patient manner, and for trades where the institution pays higher commissions.", "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "William Garrett", "title": null, "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/garrett_william.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Garrett_William_111416.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "EXECUTIVE EDUCATION", "research_interests": null, "personal_site": ""}, {"name": "William Michael Bennett", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer of Real Estate", "url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/bennett_william.aspx", "headshot_image_url": "http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/~/media/Images/faculty/headshot/Bennett_William_2012.ashx", "date_updated": "20180327", "department": "FINANCE", "research_interests": "Akason, Denise and\u00a0William Bennett. 2014.
