Only part of the large abnormal returns can be accounted for by the tendency of firms with good news to announce early.

Everything We Do, You Do: The Licensing Effect of Prosocial Marketing Messages on Consumer Behavior. Management Science. 64(1): 102-111.Do prosocial corporate marketing messages promote consumers’ altruistic behaviors, or do they advance self-interested and self-indulgent actions? To answer this question, the current research investigates the impact of different framings of prosocial marketing messages on consumers’ behaviors and choices more generally. Results from six laboratory studies and a field experiment demonstrate that exposure to messages that praise customers for good deeds can increase subsequent self-interested and self-indulgent behaviors more than messages that publicize a company’s good deeds or thank consumers for their patronage. Our findings demonstrate the possibility that a temporary boost in one’s self-concept drives this observed effect. In addition, the recipient’s level of support for the issue praised for moderates the effect of customer-praise messages on the recipient’s less altruistic behaviors. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications.",

Narrow Networks On The Health Insurance Marketplaces: Prevalence, Pricing, And The Cost Of Network Breadth. Health Affairs. 36(9): 1606-1614.Anecdotal reports and systematic research highlight the prevalence of narrow-network plans on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance Marketplaces. At the same time, Marketplace premiums in the period 2014–16 were much lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office in 2009. Using detailed data on the breadth of both hospital and physician networks, we studied the prevalence of narrow networks and quantified the association between network breadth and premiums. Controlling for many potentially confounding factors, we found that a plan with narrow physician and hospital networks was 16 percent cheaper than a plan with broad networks for both, and that narrowing the breadth of just one type of network was associated with a 6–9 percent decrease in premiums. Narrow-network plans also have a sizable impact on federal outlays, as they depress the premium of the second-lowest-price silver plan, to which subsidy amounts are linked. Holding all else constant, we estimate that federal subsidies would have been 10.8 percent higher in 2014 had Marketplaces required all plans to offer broad provider networks. Narrow networks are a promising source of potential savings for other segments of the commercial insurance market.",

Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity. London: Elsevier, Academic Press, 3rd ed.The world of finance dramatically changed following the global financial meltdown of 2007-09, and this change has continued following Brexit in 2016 and the new administration that took over in the United States during 2017. These significant events have caused governments and financial industry to look again at investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity through a new lens. Market participants have been significantly impacted, and attitudes toward risk, transparency, regulation, and compensation have changed. Investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms are at the epicenter of a transformed financial landscape, forging new roles and seeking new ways to create value within a paradigm of lower risk and greater regulation. This book provides an overview of investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms and describes the relationships between these organizations: how they both compete with and provide important services to each other, and the significant impact they have on corporations, governments, institutional investors, and individuals. Together, they have reshaped global financing and investing patterns, attracting envy and awe, but also criticism and concern. They dominate the headlines of the financial press and create wealth for many of their managers and investing clients. This book enables readers to better understand these heavily interconnected organizations, their impact on the global financial market, historical development, principal activities, regulatory environment, and risks and opportunities. Ultimately, the objective of this book is to demystify investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms, revealing their key functions, compensation systems, unique role in wealth creation and risk management and their epic battle for investor funds, and corporate influence. After reading this book, the reader should better understand financial press headlines that herald massive corporate takeovers, corporate shareholder activism, large capital market financings and the myriad strategies, risks, and conflicts in the financial market landscape. The inclusion of case studies and spreadsheet models provides an analytical framework that allows the reader to apply the book's lessons to real-world financing, investing, and advisory activities.",

Individual Discount Rates and Climate Change: Is Discount Rate Associated With Support for a Carbon Tax?. Climate Change EConomics. 6(4)The issue of climate change is often framed as one in which contemporary actions, often with affixed costs, are necessary in order to prevent even greater costs being paid during a period in the future. Under such a framework it is thus necessary to calculate the rate in which future benefits are discounted to reflect current values. In this paper we examine how individual level discount rates affect their support for a policy tool that incurs contemporary costs in an effort to prevent future environmental damages. We find that individuals with higher discount rates are significantly less likely to support the imposition of a carbon tax in comparison with individuals that have lower discount rates. Even when controlling for other individual level attributes such as party affiliation a person’s rate for discounting the future is shown to be a strong predictor of their support for a carbon tax.",

Consumer Responsiveness to Simple Health Care Prices: Evidence From Tiered Hospital Networks.This paper shows that consumers price-shop for complex health care when they can easily assess out-of-pocket prices. Health care cost containment efforts increasingly incentivize price-shopping, despite a dearth of evidence that this steers consumers toward lower-priced care for major medical services. I show that consumers price-shop in the highly simplified price information environment of health insurance plans with tiered hospital networks. These consumers observe a single predictable, well-defined price that applies to a broad range of services within each of at most three tiers of hospitals. The savings from price-shopping are large enough to both compensate for consumer welfare losses and raise insurer profits.",https://sites.google.com/view/eprager

The Review of Financial Studies. 23(3): 962-1003.We compare the trading performance of independent directors and other officers of the firm. We find that independent directors earn positive and substantial abnormal returns when they purchase their company stock, and that the difference with the same firm s officers is relatively small at most horizons. The results are robust to controlling for firm fixed effects and to using a variety of alternative specifications. Executive officers and independent directors make higher returns in firms with weaker governance and the gap between these two groups widens in such firms. Independent directors who sit in audit committees earn higher return than other independent directors at the same firm. Finally, independent directors earn significantly higher returns than the market when they sell the company stock in a window before bad news and around a restatement announcement.",https://sites.google.com/view/eravina/home

Roadblock to Innovation: The Role Of Patent Litigation in Corporate R&D.The recent spike in patent litigation raises concerns about the ability of the current intellectual property system to effectively promote innovation. Using a difference-in-difference design around the 2006 Supreme Court decision “eBay vs. MercExchange,” I examine how patent enforcement can reduce the negative effects of litigation on firms’ innovation. This ruling was intended to curb abusive patent lawsuits by providing more flexibility in the way courts remedy patent violations. I estimate the causal impact of the decision by comparing firms that were differentially affected by the shock, measured by exogenous firm-level exposure to patent litigation before 2006. Across a large sample of innovative firms, the decision led to an increase in the quality and quantity of patenting and, for public firms, in R&D investment. Then, I show that patent litigation reduces investment in innovation by lowering the returns from R&D and by exacerbating financing constraints. This evidence confirms that patent litigation plays an important role in hindering innovation, and therefore that adjustments in the enforcement of patent law can have sizable effects on R&D.",http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/mezzanotti/index.html

Global Aircraft Manufacturing, 2002–2011. Case 5-312-505 (KEL938).At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Boeing and Airbus, the leading manufacturers of large aircraft, were locked in a battle for market share that drove down prices for their new planes. At about the same time, the two industry heavyweights began developing new aircraft families to address the future market needs they each projected.
Aircraft take many years to develop, so by the time the new planes made their inaugural flights, significant changes had occurred in the global environment. First, emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere were growing rapidly, spawning immediate and long-term demand for more aircraft. At the same time, changes to the market for air travel had created opportunities for new products. These opportunities had not gone unnoticed by potential new entrants, which were positioning themselves to compete against the market leaders.
In October 2007, the Airbus superjumbo A380 made its first flight. The A380 carried more passengers than any other plane in history and had been touted as a solution to increased congestion at global mega-hub airports. Four years later the Boeing 787, a smaller long-range aircraft, was launched to service secondary cities in a point-to-point network.
The case provides students with an opportunity to analyze the profit potential of the global aircraft manufacturing industry in 2002 and in 2011. Students can also identify the actions of participants that weakened or intensified the pressure on profits within the industry.

Regulating Household Leverage.This paper studies how credit markets respond to policy constraints on household leverage. Exploiting a sharp policy-induced discontinuity in the cost of originating certain high-leverage mortgages, we study how the Dodd-Frank “Ability-to-Repay” rule affected the price and availability of credit in the U.S. mortgage market. Our estimates show that the policy had only moderate effects on prices, increasing interest rates on affected loans by 10-15 basis points. The effect on quantities, however, was signiﬁcantly larger; we estimate that the policy eliminated 15 percent of the affected market completely and reduced leverage for another 20 percent of remaining borrowers. This reduction in quantities is much greater than would be implied by plausible demand elasticities and suggests that lenders responded to the policy primarily by rationing credit. Finally, while the policy succeeded in reducing leverage, our estimates suggest this effect would have only slightly reduced aggregate default rates during the housing crisis.",https://sites.google.com/site/johnnelsonmondragon/

Exploring the Case for a Global Alliance for Medical Diagnostics Initiative. Diagnostics. 7(1): 8.In recent years, the private and public sectors have increased investments in medical diagnostics for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite these investments, numerous barriers prevent the adoption of existing diagnostics and discourage the development and introduction of new diagnostics in LMICs. In the late 1990s, the global vaccine community had similar challenges, as vaccine coverage rates stagnated and the introduction of new vaccines was viewed as a distraction to delivering existing vaccines. To address these challenges, the international community came together and formed the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative (GAVI). Sixteen years after the formation of GAVI, we see evidence of a healthier global vaccine landscape. We discuss how GAVI’s four guiding principles (product, health systems strengthening, financing and market shaping) might apply to the advancement of medical diagnostics in LMICs. We present arguments for the international community and existing organizations to establish a Global Alliance for Medical Diagnostics Initiative (GAMDI).",

Leadership and Vision at Barrington United Methodist Church (A). Case 5-211-258(A).“The building is gone but the Church is still here” was the immediate thought of Pastor Jim Wilson as he watched his church structure burn to the ground in 1998. Pastor Wilson realized that as the leader of the congregation, he needed to take action to manage the crisis and to lead his congregation to a new vision of the future that might be quite different than the past. His choice of leadership style, his gathering a team of leaders around him and his creation of a strong vision for the future are lessons that nonprofit and for-profit leaders can learn from through this case. The case chronicles the story of leadership and change management that led BUMC from the ashes to a new building and a strong, growing congregation. The case brings to light several critical issues in nonprofit management: change management, leadership and vision, changing demographics and environment, and crisis management.",

Managing Careers in Organizations. Journal of Labor Economics.A firm's organizational structure imposes constraints on its ability to use promotion-based incentive systems. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a framework for identifying these constraints and exploring their consequences. We show that firms manage workers' careers by putting in place personnel policies that optimally resemble an internal labor market. Firms may adopt forced-turnover policies in order to keep lines of advancement open. In addition, they may alter their organizational structures to relax these constraints. This gives rise to a trade-off between incentive provision at the worker level and productive efficiency at the firm level. Our framework generates novel testable implications that connect firm-level characteristics with workers' careers in ways that are consistent with a rich set of empirical findings.",http://www.pareto-optimal.com

Forthcoming. Platform Flexibility Strategies: Investment versus Customization Tradeoff. European Journal of Operations Research.Product platforms are flexible assets that facilitate cost-efficient product variety. How much investment in platform flexibility is desirable? We study the platform flexibility investment decision: when is it better to develop low-end or high-end platforms (aligned with the functional- ities of a specific product), or to invest in middle-end platforms with cheaper low- and high-end customization, or in ultimate platforms that cover the functionalities of the entire product range at negligible customization? Or is a portfolio of these platforms better? We present a mathemat- ical model of the platform portfolio flexibility decision where each platform comes with its own fixed investment and variable customization cost. We characterize the optimal strategy using an investment-customization tradeoff curve and value the economies of scale and scope embedded in platforms via comparative statics of investment and customization costs, as well as the mean and covariances of the demand forecast.",

Forthcoming. Aint it Suite? Bundling in the PC Office Software Market. Strategic Management Journal.We examine the importance of office suites for the evolution of the PC office software market in the 1990s. An estimated discrete demand choice model reveals a positive correlation of consumer values for spreadsheets and word processors, a bonus value for suites, and advantages for Microsoft products. We employ the estimates to simulate various hypothetical market structures to evaluate the profitability, welfare, and competitive effects of suites under alternative correlation assumptions. We find that greater correlation enhances the profitability of bundling due to the interaction of a market expansion effect and a suite bonus effect. In a partial competition setting in which Lotus sells only a spreadsheet and WordPerfect sells only a word processor, we find that Microsoft’s introduction of the suite increases consumer welfare. Furthermore, while the Lotus and WordPerfect suites gained little market acceptance, a merger that creates a new suite combining the best products of both enhances competition only if the new suite overcomes Microsoft’s unobserved quality advantage.",http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/markovich/index.html

The marketing and consumer research fields began to flourish in the late 1940s after World War II. Social Research, Inc. was founded in 1946 by members of the University of Chicago's faculty. Students at the University's interdisciplinary Committee on Human Development and the Departments of Sociology, Anthropology, and Psychology worked at Social Research, Inc., pioneering the application of behavioral methods of research to problems of business and other organizations. This paper traces the transmission of knowledge from the academic setting to the business environment. It notes especially the influence of members of the university faculty and their theories of human behavior on the emerging fields devoted to the study of consumption and culture.",

Archives of physical medicince and rehabilitation.(98): 1210-1216.Objective

To describe the qualitative process used to develop attributes and attribute levels for inclusion in a discrete choice experiments (DCE) for older adult physical activity interventions.

Design

Five focus groups (n=41) were conducted, grounded in the Health Action Process Approach framework. Discussion emphasized identification and prioritization attributes for a DCE on physical activity. Semi-structured interviews (n=6) investigated attribute levels and lay-language for the DCE. A focus group with physical activity researchers and health care providers was the final stakeholder group used to establish a comprehensive approach for the generation of attributes and levels. A DCE pilot test (n=8) was then conducted with individuals of the target patient population. All transcripts were analyzed using a constant comparative approach.",

Predicting Equity Liquidity. Management Science. 48(4): 470-483.In this paper we quantify equity liquidity using a measure of price impact, the change in a firm's stock price associated with its observed net trading volume and relate the measured price impact to a set of predetermined firm characteristics that serve as proxies for the severity of adverse selection in the equity market, the non-information based costs of making a market in the stock, and the extent of shareholder heterogeneity; and compare, out-of-sample, our characteristic-based estimates of price impact to actual price impacts. Increasing the magnitude of net turnover during a 5-minute interval by 0.1% of the shares outstanding produces an average incremental price effect of 2.65% for NYSE and AMEX listed firms and 1.85% for NASDAQ firms. These averages, however, mask considerable cross-sectional variation. We present evidence that liquidity varies cross-sectionally as a function of predetermined firm characteristics as predicted by theories based on adverse selection, market making costs, and shareholder heterogeneity. We also find intra-day patterns, with the price impact being higher at the beginning and end of the trading day relative to the middle of the day. For a large set of institutional trades we examine the relation between actual price impact and that predicted out-of-sample using the cross sectional relation between firm characteristics and price impact. We find numerous aspects of trade execution which are significantly related to the price impact forecast error in intuitive ways: for example, the predicted price impact overestimates the actual price impact for very large trades, for trades executed in a more patient manner, and for trades where the institution pays higher commissions.",

Case 5-413-753 (KEL799).The case puts students in the shoes of Todd Davis, founder and CEO of a boutique brownfield redevelopment firm, Hemisphere Development, in 2010. Davis is wrestling with decisions and processes surrounding the potential acquisition and redevelopment of the former Delphi Automotive plant in Columbus, Ohio. When making the investment decision, Davis (and students) must consider various factors: What is Hemisphere's implicit investment strategy, and what are the firm's core competencies? How should the firm finance this transaction to achieve an acceptable return?
In addition to presenting a brownfield and strategy exercise, this case exposes students to concepts and terminologies used in real estate and environmental projects, including brownfields, public-private partnerships, and creative financing. Finally, the case highlights real-life examples of balancing risk and return.",
